Feature: RESTFUL - BOOKER
  RestFul-Booker contains end-points that allow Create, Read, Update and
  Delete reservations. The Web API comes with authentication features and is loaded with a bunch of bugs.
  so you can explore. The API comes preloaded with 10 registers so you can work and reset
  every 10 minutes to that default state.
